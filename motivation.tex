Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is a go-to method for installing subsurface pipelines, telecommunication cables, power lines, and sewers without digging trenches. 
The traditional methodology follows a pre-defined path to drill a horizontal well under surface obstacles such as rivers or inhabited areas. 
In the last few years, logging-while-drilling (LWD) measurements developed for oil and gas drilling have become more affordable and made their way to civil drilling. 
They enable geosteering of shallow wells: intensional real-time trajectory adjustment to adapt to the observed subsurface environment as the uncertainty gets reduced with new measurements.
