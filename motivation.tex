Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is a go-to method for installing subsurface pipelines, telecommunication cables, power lines, and sewers without digging trenches. 
The traditional methodology follows a pre-defined path to drill a horizontal well under surface obstacles such as rivers or inhabited areas. 
In the last few years, logging-while-drilling (LWD) measurements developed for oil and gas drilling have become more affordable and made their way to civil drilling.

They enable shallow-well geosteering \cite{johnson2021using,ungemach2021real}: intentional real-time trajectory adjustment to adapt to the observed subsurface environment.

\hlt{Underbore} \cite{underbore2022} is an open-source game created to explain HDD and geosteering and some of their challenges to a wider audience \cite{coding2022,practical2022}. 
We seek \hlt{collaborators} and \hlt{new ideas} for developing Under-Bore further.
