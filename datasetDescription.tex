The dataset consists of stratigraphic vertical depth (\textbf{SVD}) curves and offset-well logs (gamma ray and ROP) from the GWC 2020, Semi-final well (Middle Woodford formation in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) \cite{gwc-paper}. 
% These are based on the Middle Woodford formation in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province. 
The logs for the current (horizontal) well are generated by sampling the offset logs along the selected SVD function.

For training the MDN, we used a synthetic dataset containing 28 million samples of randomly generated SVD functions with variable dip angles and faulting \cite{trainingdata}.
