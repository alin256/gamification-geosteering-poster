In the GWC example, using gamma ray and ROP logs as inputs, the predicted SVD function (in black) closely tracked the true stratigraphic curve (in green), including the fault at 2750ft MD. Predicted ROP probability distributions cover the true ROP log, even in the presence of faulting.

The total computation time for this example was 443ms on a standard PC, about two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art stratigraphy interpretation methods.
