	\item[1] We presented a deep-learning-based method for sequential interpretation of well logs during geosteering.
	\item[2] In the presence of unexpected features such as high dips and large faults, the method manages to recover the correct
solution while also tracking other likely modes.
	\item[3] The method can provide probabilistic estimates of ROP 16ft ahead, without additional inputs or training.
	\item[4] The tracking is done in real-time, with an interpretation speed of about 2600 ft/s.
\end{itemize}
