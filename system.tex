% system description

\newcommand{\lefheight}{12.8}

%We present a recently created  open source web simulation game that demonstrates shallow geosteering. 
As a player you are challenged to Under-Bore the river in 2D by only controlling the bit's bias, either up or down, and hence the drilling direction.

You must avoid subsurface obstacles hidden behind the “fog of uncertainty”.

%and reach the target across a river by only controlling the bit's bias, either up or down, and hence the drilling direction. 
%\fig{}{figs/fog.png}{\lefheight}
%The “fog of uncertainty” hides subsurface obstacles: large boulders. 
In the pre-drill stage, the obstacle tops are detected by seismology and shown as dots. 

\fig{}{figs/seismic.png}{\lefheight}


As you start drilling, the fog clears following the bit, simulating an LWD tool with a limited look around.

%add pull back figure?

\fig{}{figs/tool.png}{\lefheight}

If you hit a boulder, you can pull back on the pipe and try drilling in another direction. But the drill bit will get broken after three collisions. 


%The final score accounts for the total length drilled, the final length of the well, and the number of stuck times. 


% The prototype demonstrates the HDD and geosteering principles to a general audience and enables experimenting with AI training in the simulated environment.
